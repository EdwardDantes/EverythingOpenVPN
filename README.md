# EverythingOpenVPN
An automated bash setup script, example client/server .conf files, and an iptables updating script.

OpenVPN has been the best way in my experience to set up your own vpn channels.  While there are several ways
to increase speed and lower security the goal with the scripts contained in this repository is to have most of the security options available and to easily add more... While nothing here is done to add anything fancy other than some bash scripting the goal is to semi-automate the process for the developer/programmer/engineer who already understands how the OpenVPN system works.  The addition of client/server configuration files helps speed the process up. The iptables updating script also adds most new rules that I have useful. Please read each file carefully, notes should explain what your need to know and do. All files require custom names, ip addresses and dates to be filled in.
